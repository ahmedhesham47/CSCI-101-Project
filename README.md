"""PySequence 1.0"""

This is a software program that helps molecular biologists and geneticists do comprehensive analyses on DNA & RNA strands. The program consists of many features, of which each includes many sub-features. 1) Analyze
1.	Single-Strand Analysis:

This feature allows the user to analyze some aspects about one DNA strand, things like the number of each nucleotide, the G-C content, whether the strand is a palindrome, whether a specific segment exists or not, and so on. The user can also reverse transcriptase an RNA strand to convert it to DNA strand, in which such a process is crucial to the “life” of some viruses.

2.	Multi-Strand Analysis:

This feature allows the user to compare two strands SIMULTANEOUSLY, things like the matching percentage between those strands and the most matching nucleotides. The user can also input a file and see the most matching two sequences from a given number N of sequences. Finally, the user can also compare a certain viral sequence with a given number N of sequences in a file to see the most matching of them with the virus.
2) Central Dogma
1.	Transcribe DNA: Here, the user can transcribe a DNA strand {NO DOUBLE HELIX; only One-strand}
2.	Translate RNA: Here, the user can translate an mRNA strand to its corresponding polypeptide chain.
3.	Automate Transcription and Translation: Here, the user can transcribe and translate a DNA strand to its corresponding polypeptide chain(s), where the strand is treated as if it contains multiple genes, each starting from a start codon at a certain position in the strand.
3) Manual
•	This is to explain to the user, in an image gallery viewer, the most fundamental biological concepts so that he/she uses the program most efficiently.
